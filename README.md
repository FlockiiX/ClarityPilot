## Inspiration

In today’s high-pressure academic and professional environments, especially for students, researchers, and developers mental overload has become the norm.
We constantly juggle tasks across platforms like Jira, Slack, GitHub, Notion, and email.
Meanwhile, our wearables collect tons of health data, but fail to turn it into meaningful, actionable guidance.

**We asked ourselves:**
Why do our tools know so much about us but do so little for us?
Where is the companion that understands our work patterns and cares for our cognitive well-being?

That question became the spark for **ClarityPilot**: a proactive health companion that bridges the yawning gap between the (unhelpful) raw data and impactful, actionable recommendations

## What ClarityPilot does

ClarityPilot lives right on your home screen.
Its mission: help you conquer cognitive overload with actionable, personalized recommendations.

- **Key features**:

  - **Unified Workload Intelligence**: Connect all your work platforms like Jira, Slack, or GitHub. Using webhooks and integrations, ClarityPilot tracks how long you’ve been working, what you’re working on, and when your workload peaks.

- **Cognitive State Estimation**:

  - Aggregate work context from productivity tools & Screen-time and focus information

- **Proactive, AI-powered Interventions**:
  - Not just another dashboard. ClarityPilot nudges you before burnout hits.

> "You’ve been debugging for 97 minutes straight—how about a 10-minute reset to Bierbräu Garching?"

- **Accessibility-first Home Screen Widget**: A clean, dynamic, always-visible widget provides:
  - Instant insights
  - Personalized nudges
  - Micro-suggestions for mood, recovery, and productivity
  - Widget UI dynamically generated by our Agent and rendered by our App

ClarityPilot isn’t passive. It’s your co-pilot! Anticipating your state and guiding you toward healthier, more sustainable work habits.

## Tech Stack

### Native Android app (100% Kotlin)

Chosen for performance with focus on accessibility capabilities, and deep OS-level integration for widgets and background services.

### Tracking Integrations

- GitHub: Push events + commit frequency + PR activity
- Jira: Webhooks + OAuth to track issue transitions, time-in-status
- Slack: Event API to detect messaging bursts, work intensity
- [coming soon] Google Fit: Activity and biometrics

### AI-powered Recommendation Engine

A lightweight, LLM based pipeline condenses individual sensor & productivity data into bigger milestones, which are used to generating context-aware recommendations using an agentic LLM based pipeline:

### Proactive Delivery System

Uses Android’s foreground services + widget updates + notifications to deliver time-sensitive nudges.

## Challenges we ran into

- Integrating heterogeneous APIs (Slack, GitHub, Jira, wearables) with different auth workflows and event structures
- Balancing helpfulness vs. intrusiveness when crafting proactive recommendations
- Widget refresh constraints on Android (rate limits, update cycles, battery impact)
- Ensuring privacy and security while handling sensitive health and work data
- **Time** :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We built a fully functional Kotlin-native Android app with a polished home-screen widget
- Achieved live workload monitoring from multiple developer tools through webhooks
- Developed a multi turn agentic LLM based recommendation engine that generates meaningful, context-aware suggestions
- Delivered a clean, accessibility-focused UI that feels like a true digital companion
- Built something students, developers, researchers, and even ourselves, would genuinely use every day

## What we learned

- Cognitive overload is measurable but only when combining both physiological and digital work signals
- Even small nudges (break suggestions, micro-recovery prompts) can dramatically reduce stress accumulation
- Android’s widget and accessibility ecosystems are powerful
- Integrations are everything: productivity tools hold the missing half of the mental health equation
- On the fly user tailored AI generated UI is very powerful

## What's next for ClarityPilot

ClarityPilot is just taking off. Here’s where we want to go:

- Activity and biometrics from wearables
- Expanded integration ecosystem (Notion, Linear, VS Code telemetry, email clients)
- Gamified recovery streaks to encourage healthy habits
- In-app journal and reflection insights
- On-device inference for maximum privacy
- iOS version once the Android companion is fully refined
- Enterprise dashboard for burnout-prevention analytics (with strong anonymity protections)

Our long-term vision:
Deep integration with mobile operating system that help us all prevent burnout and live a healthier life.
